# Comparision-of-ANN-and-Logistic
In this model, predictions are made through logistic regression initailly. Output of Logistic Regression is then compared with output of Artificial Neural Network. 


In this model I have used sklearn libarary and keras with tensorflow beckend.

Using  pandas , numpy ,seaborn , matplotlib , Logistic Regression , Artificial Neural Network to predict outcome.
